//~ Monotonic Stack
//* A monotonic stack is a stack data structure that is used to solve problems related to finding the next greater or smaller element in an array.

//* In a monotonic stack, the elements are pushed onto the stack in a way that the top element of the stack always satisfies a certain order.

//* One of the key benefits of using a monotonic stack is that it allows us to avoid nested loops and unnecessary comparisons, which can significantly reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

//~ Monotonic Increasing Stack:
//* It is a stack in which the elements are in increasing order from the bottom to the top of the stack.
//* we should not have a smaller element at top of a bigger element.

//& Before pushing into the stack, POP all the elements till either of one condition fails:
//* Stack is not empty
//* Stackâ€™s top is bigger than the element to be inserted.
//& Then push the element into the stack.
