//~ BFS Vs DFS

//* Time :- O(V+E)

//* Space :- O(V) (worst)

//* BFS: O(b^d) vs DFS: O(bd)

//* BFS gives shortest path (Optimal) which is not the case in DFS

//* If you know solution is near to root then BFS is preferable otherwise DFS

//~ Analogy
//* Let's say your family tree starts with your grandfather's father
//* Now if you want to find alive person in your family then DFS is preferred and if you want to find not alive member then BFS can be efficient
